Hello and welcome to Crimson Orange.

Crimson Orange (nicknamed as Honoka) is a 2D platformer game framework built around Gosu and Chingu. Initially made as a demonstration project for A* algorithm implementation in 2D platformer games.

Albeit to Chingu's developement status, Honoka utilizes its functions to work. In future (and when my understanding in coding is better than mine today), Honoka will use its own functions.

Built with the spirit of love and live by kuehkookies.

## (Planned) Features

- Understandable and cleaner object hierarchies
- Module integration, giving possibility of plug-and-play modules creation
- Ease of building stages
- Provide cleaner and faster prototyping tools for platformer games. Initially Honoka provides several logics which utilizes Gosu's functions and further strengthened by Chingu

## Todo

- [ ] Base logics integration
- [ ] Resource Managements
  - [ ] Better caching system
- [ ] Configurable key inputs
- [ ] Samples
  - [ ] Splash Screen sample
  - [ ] Menu sample
  - [ ] Stage sample
- [ ] Music
  - [x] Add Stop command
  - [ ] Make music loopable
